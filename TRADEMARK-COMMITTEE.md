The Knative Trademark Committee (KTC)
[advises the trademark owner on the usage and enforcement of the Knative mark](./GOVERNANCE.md).
It is a separate body from the [Steering Committee](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) to
better represent the needs of vendors and other companies which market products
in conjuction with the Knative mark.

The governance of Knative is an open, living document, and will continue to
evolve as the community and project change. We expect over time we will adapt
the way we run this committee, based on feedback from the community.

## Charter

1. Advise the Trademark owner on the definition and enforcement of the "Knative"
   trademark usage and branding guidelines.

1. Review and approve conformance rules and tests that define brand use
   decisions.

1. Review and approve the scope and definition of additional derivative Knative
   marks (e.g. Knative Serving, Knative Core, etc). It is expected that the
   Trademark Committee will delegate one or more marks to the steering committee
   to provide branding for nascent efforts which are not yet subject to
   conformance and third-party licensing.

1. Only the Trademark Committee can redefine its own charter, membership, and
   authority over Knative Trademark, conformance, and brand decisions.

## Delegated authority

The Trademark Committee may choose create and delegate its authority to other
committees as-needed. This may be used (for example) to create sub-committees
for specific technical or marketing questions related to conformance or joint
marketing.

## Committee Meetings

The committee meets as-needed. Meetings are held online.

Given the private nature of some of these discussions (e.g. trade secrets, legal
and compliance concerns, etc.) some meetings are held in private.

Meeting notes are available to members of the
[knative-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-dev)
(note: these are accessible to members of the knative-users list as well).
Public meetings will be recorded and the recordings made available publicly.

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as
[issues in the community repo](https://github.com/knative/community/issues), and
the trademark committee invites your feedback there. See
[Getting in touch](#getting-in-touch) for other options.

## Decision process

The Trademark Committee desires to always reach consensus. Additionally, each
member can veto decisions regarding assignment of the mark, charter,
conformance, and scope.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may
pass with at least half the members of the committee supporting it. Vetoes by
absent committee members must be presented within 5 business days of a published
decision.

Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the members are present.
Quorum may be established over email or electronic chat systems as well as via
video or in-person meetings.

In case of extended absence or removal from the project for a code of conduct
violation, the organization of the absent member may appoint a single
replacement delegate from the same company during the absence.

## Getting in touch

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the steering committee at
   [knative-trademark@googlegroups.com](mailto:knative-trademark@googlegroups.com).
   This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have
   access.
2. Open an issue on a knative repository and indicate that you would like
   attention from the trademark committee.

## Composition

The Trademark Committee is composed of company representatives from companies
which have substantially contributed to Knative over the last year, as well as
the trademark holder. These representatives shall be confirmed by the Knative
Steering Committee; companies which have a currently-unfilled seat on the
Trademark Committee may veto decisions made while the seat was empty as if those
decisions had been made at the time of confirmation.

Company representatives serving on the Trademark Committee may individually
resign or be removed from their seats by their affiliated company with at least
5 days notice.

For the 2020 year, one seat is assigned to each of Google, IBM/RedHat, and
VMware. The committee shall review this composition and the selection rules at
least annually in October of each year (to be aligned with the Steering
elections process).

### Maintaining the Trademark Committee

The Trademark Committee membership is refreshed annually on the same timeline as
the Steering Committee elections (during the month of October). The Trademark
Committee's size is unbounded and may grow or shrink depending on the activity
in the project in the year prior to each refresh.

Membership in the committee is determined by counting the
[easily countable contributions over the last year](https://knative.teststats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions).
Each company which has contributed at least 15% of the total project
contributions will be eligible to select one representative to the committee.
Not all contributions are easy to count and many significant contributions are
hard to count. There will be an exception process that allows vendors to
articulate why they should receive consideration for membership on the Trademark
Committee. Corporate parents, affiliates, or subsidiares shall be counted as one
company.

The current Trademark Committee membership will consider easily countable
contributions and exception requests when determining the Trademark Committee
membership for the next year.
