## Charter

1. Advise the Trademark owner on the definition and enforcement of the "Knative"
   trademark usage and branding guidelines.

1. Review and approve conformance rules and tests that define brand use
   decisions.

1. Review and approve the scope and definition of additional derivative Knative
   marks (e.g. Knative Serving, Knative Core, etc). It is expected that the
   Trademark Committee will delegate one or more marks to the steering committee
   to provide branding for nascent efforts which are not yet subject to
   conformance and third-party licensing.

1. Only the Trademark Committee can redefine its own charter, membership, and
   authority over Knative Trademark, conformance, and brand decisions.

## Decision process

The Trademark Committee desires to always reach consensus. Additionally, each
member can veto decisions regarding assignment of the mark, charter,
conformance, and scope.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may
pass with at least half the members of the committee supporting it. Vetoes by
absent committee members must be presented within 5 business days of a published
decision.

Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the members are
present. Quorum may be established over email or electronic chat systems as well
as via video or in-person meetings.

In case of extended absence or removal from the project for a code of conduct
violation, the organization of the absent member may appoint a single
replacement delegate from the same company during the absence.

## Committee Meetings

The committee meets as-needed. Meetings are held online.

Given the private nature of some of these discussions (e.g. trade secrets, legal
and compliance concerns, etc.) some meetings are held in private.

Meeting notes are available to members of the [knative-dev mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-dev) (note: these are
accessible to members of the knative-users list as well). Public meetings will
be recorded and the recordings made available publicly.

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as [issues in the
community repo](https://github.com/knative/community/issues), and the trademark
committee invites your feedback there. See [Raising
Issues](#raising-issue-to-the-trademark-committee) for other options.

## Raising issues to the steering committee

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the steering committee at
   [knative-trademark@googlegroups.com](mailto:knative-trademark@googlegroups.com).
   This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have
   access.
2. Open an issue on a knative repository and indicate that you would like
   attention from the trademark committee.

## Composition

The Trademark Committee is composed of company representatives from companies
which have substantially contributed to Knative over the last year, as well as
the trademark holder. These representatives shall be confirmed by the Knative
Steering Committee; companies which have a currently-unfilled seat on the
Trademark Committee may veto decisions made while the seat was empty as if those
decisions had been made at the time of confirmation.

Each company which has contributed at least [15% of the total project
contributions](https://knative.teststats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions)
will be eligible to select one representative to the committee. Corporate
representatives may also petition the Trademark Committee to have non-tangible
project contributions (such as marketing support, community management, etc)
considered in addition to contributions measured via the CNCF GitHub
tooling. Any exceptions shall be recorded with evidence and
"contribution-equivalent" scores. Corporate parents, affiliates, or subsidiares
shall be counted as one company.

Company representatives serving on the Trademark Committee may individually
resign or be removed from their seats by their affiliated company with at least
5 days notice.

For the 2020 year, one seat is assigned to each of Google, IBM/RedHat, and
VMware. The committee shall review this composition and the selection rules at
least annually in October of each year (to be aligned with the Steering
elections process).
