I have been a long time member of the Knative community, mostly serving on the
TOC and organizing some activities behind the scenes.  I've worked on most
areas of the project, and helped write a number of the governance documents, as
well as helping to push for the donation of Knative to the CNCF in 2021 and
2022.  I've also appeared a number of times on the community tech talk
calendar, and have contributed to many of the areas of the project at one time
or another.

I'm interested in serving on the Steering Committee because I'd like to be able
to officially leverage my contacts and experience with the Cloud-Native
community to better stitch Knative into the overall Cloud-Native application
platform, and to get more experience with running an awesome community like
this one.

In addition to the direct community contributions, I'm also [writing a book on
building serverless applications which features Knative](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-serverless-applications/9781098142063/),
and I'm interested in connecting Knative with other communities both within and
outside the CNCF.

In addition to my work on Knative, I'm a current member of the Sigstore oncall
rotation, and I've served on the Kubecon program committee for the last two
KubeCons, and helped organize KnativeCon in 2022 and AppDeveloperCon at KubeCon
NA 2023.
