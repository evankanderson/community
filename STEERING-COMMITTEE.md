The Knative Steering Committee (KSC) is the ultimate authority for the Knative
project, and governs all aspects of the project.

The governance of Knative is an open, living document, and will continue to
evolve as the community and project change. We expect over time we will adapt
the way we run this committee, based on feedback from the community.

## Charter

1. Define, evolve, and promote the vision, values, mission, and scope of the
   project.
1. Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including
   project roles and how collaborators become members, approvers, leads, and/or
   administrators. This includes policy for the creation and administration of
   [working groups](./working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md) and committees.
1. Steward, control access, delegate access, and establishes processes
   regarding, all Knative project resources and has the final say in the
   disposition of those resources.
1. Manage the Knative brand and decide which things can be called "Knative" and
   how that mark can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
1. Confirm/reject nominations to the Technical Oversight Committee.
1. Receive and handle reports about [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
   violations and maintain confidentiality.
1. Receive security reports; work with the appropriate technical leads to accept
   or reject the report; maintain the private nature of such reports until
   disclosed to the broader community.
1. Act as the final escalation point and decider for any disputes, issues,
   clarifications, or escalations within the project scope.

## Delegated authority

KSC may choose to delegate its authority to other committees as-needed. The
committee currently recognizes this delegated authority for:

- Technical guidance is delegated to the
  [Technical Oversight Committee](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md).

## Committee Meetings

KSC meets every two weeks, or as-needed. Meetings are held online.

Given the private nature of some of these discussions (e.g. privacy, private
emails to the committee, code of conduct violations, escalations, disputes
between members, security reports, etc.) some meetings are held in private.

Meeting notes are available to members of the [knative-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-dev).

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as
[issues in the docs repo](https://github.com/knative/docs/issues), and the KSC
invites your feedback there. See [Raising Issues](#raising-issue-to-the-steering-committee) for other
options.

## Committee members

Seats on the Steering Committee are held by an individual, not by their employer.

When the Knative project was created, it was assigned strong corporate
leadership through organizationally appointed steering committee members. As a
mature project with production adoption, the project has moved to a democratic
process of selecting new SC members.  This process may change again in the
future as Knative continues to grow.

The current membership of the committee is currently (listed alphabetically by
first name):

\* Open seats have been allocated to the organization per the prior committee rules,
  but have not been assigned to a member of the organization or replaced with elected seats.

## Decision process

The steering committee desires to always reach consensus.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may
pass with majority of the committee supporting it.

Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the members are present.

## Raising issues to the steering committee

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the steering committee at
   [knative-steering@googlegroups.com](mailto:knative-steering@googlegroups.com).
   This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have
   access.
2. Open an issue on a knative repository and indicate that you would like
   attention from the steering committee.

## Composition

The steering committee will have 7 seats.  Five of the seats will be
Contributing seats, open to any project contributor.  Two of the seats will be
End-User seats, open only to active end-user community members.  See Candidate
Eligibility for definitions of these categories.

Steering Committee members will serve for 2-year terms, staggered in order to
preserve continuity.  Every year either two or three contributor seats will be
elected, and one end user seat will be elected.

## Election Procedure

### Timeline

Steering Committee elections shall be held in October or November of each year.
Six weeks or more before the election, the Steering Committee shall appoint
Election Officer(s) (see below).  Four weeks or more before the election, the
Election Officer(s) will issue a call for nominations, publish the list of
voters, and open the call for exceptions.  One week before the election the call
for nominations and exceptions will be closed.  The election will be open for
voting not less than two weeks and not more than four.  The results of the
election shall be announced within one week of closing the election.  New
Steering Committee members will take office on December 1 of each year.

### Election Officer(s)

Six weeks or more before the election, the Steering Committee will appoint
between one and three Election Officer(s) to administer the election.  Elections
Officers will be Knative community members in good standing who are eligible to
vote, are not running for Steering in that election, and can make a public
promise of impartiality.  They will be responsible for:

* Making all announcements associated with the election
* Preparing and distributing electronic ballots
* Judging exception requests
* Assisting candidates in preparing and sharing statements
* Tallying voting results according to the rules in this charter

### Eligibility to Vote

Anyone who has at least 50 contributions in the last 12 months is eligible to
vote in the Steering election. Contributions are defined as opening PRs,
reviewing and commenting on PRs, opening and commenting on issues, writing
design docs, commenting on design docs, helping people on slack, participating
in working groups, and other efforts that help advance Knative the project.

[This
dashboard]((https://knative.teststats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year)
shows only GitHub based contributions and does not capture all the contributions
we value. We expect this metric not to capture everyone who should be eligible
to vote. If a community member has had significant contributions over the past
year but is not captured in the [stats.knative.dev
dashboard](https://knative.teststats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year),
they will be able to submit an exception form to the Elections Officer(s) who
will then review and determine whether this member should be marked as an
exception.  All exceptions, and the reasons for them, will be recorded in a log
that will be available to Steering and the TOC.

All eligible voters will be captured at
knative/community/steering-elections/$YEAR/voters.md and the votersâ€™ guide will
be captured at knative/community/steering-elections/$YEAR/README.md, similar to
the kubernetes election process and identical to the TOC election process.

We are committed to an inclusive process and will adapt future eligibility
requirements based on community feedback.

### Candidate Eligibility

Community members must be eligible to vote in order to stand for election (this
includes voters who qualify for an exception). Candidates may self-nominate or
be nominated by another eligible member. The approximate time commitment of a
Steering member is around 5 hours per week.

To run for a Contributing seat, a candidate must additionally be at least a
project Member as defined in Roles.md.

To run for an End-User seat, a candidate must be employed by, or own, an
organization that does not sell products or services derived from Knative.
Staff with in-house Knative deployments, as well as application developers who
create applications that run on Knative, are eligible (and encouraged to run)
for these seats.  Additionally, the candidate must participate in the
knative-users mailing list and/or community-facing Knative Slack channels.

### Voting Procedure

Elections will be held using a time-limited
[Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) ranking on
[CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) using the Schulze method. The top
vote-getters will be elected to the open seats, with the exceptions for company
representation discussed below. This is the same process used for TOC elections.

### Limitations on Company Representation

No more than two seats may be held by employees of the same organization (or
conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other).  Additionally, the two
End-User seats may not belong to employees of the same organization. If the
results of an election result in greater than two employees of the same
organization, the lowest vote getters from any particular employer will be
removed until representation on the committee is down to two.

If employers change because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, in a
way that would yield more than 2 seats being held by employees of the same
organization, sufficient members of the committee must resign until only two
employees of the same employer are left. If it is impossible to find sufficient
members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and new
special elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for
example evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all
non-involved Steering Committee members will decide.

## Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected SC member, the
candidate with the next most votes from the previous election will be offered
the seat, provided that person otherwise qualifies to join the SC. This process
will continue until the seat is filled.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will
be held as soon as possible, unless the regular SC election is less than 7 weeks
away.  Eligible voters from the most recent election will vote in the special
election (ie: eligibility will not be redetermined at the time of the special
election). Any replacement SC member will serve out the remainder of the term
for the person they are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.

## Transition

In order to transition from the original, organization-appointed Steering
Committee structure, elections will be phased in over 14 months.

In October 2020, four positions will be elected, including three Contributing
seats and one End-User seat.  One Google, one Red Hat/IBM, and one VMWare seat
will be retained from the current Steering Committee.

In October or November 2021, the three "old SC" seats will be replaced by
elected seats (two Contributing and one End-User).

## Changes to the charter

Changes to the KSC charter may be proposed via a Pull Request on the charter
itself. Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee.

Proposals and amendments to the charter are available for at least a period of
one week for comments and questions before a vote will occur.
